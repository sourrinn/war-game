## Rules

If you are new to War or need a refresher, feel free to review the rules before playing the game. War is a card game where the objective is to collect all the cards by winning battles. The deck is evenly divided between the players, and each player plays a card from the top of their deck simultaneously. The player with the higher-ranked card wins the battle and collects all the played cards. In the case of a tie, a war is declared, where additional cards are played face down and another battle occurs. The game continues until one player collects all the cards.

For a detailed explanation of the rules and gameplay, refer to the in-game instructions or consult reliable War card game resources.
